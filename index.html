				<h1>Hello! My name is Céline</h1>
				<img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Céline Viévard" class="img-circle img-shadowed">
				<p>
					Welcome to my page! To sum up my profile, I am French but have had the chance to live across the world. I am passionate of <strong>travelling</strong> and love <strong>animals</strong>. On the professional side, I have been <strong>working</strong> for two years for an HR start-up as Chief of Staff to the CEO, working on the marketing on the company but also on customer services 😎

				<h2>Travelling 🌎</h2>
				<p>
					I love travelling the world. Discovering new cultures, languages and foods is very exciting.
				</p>

				<h2>Sport 🥊</h2>
				<p>
					Since a very young age I have been a huge sport lover. I have tried it all: tennis, football, ballet, swimming, gymnastics, karate... Some longer than others, I have done nearly 10 years of gymnastics competing at the national level. After a series of injuries, I resorted to running! I recently did the Paris semi-marathon and count on doing more in the coming months... Looking forward to the Olympic Games where I will be volunteering at.

				<h2>Animals 🐾</h2>
				<p>
					I have an unexplainable love for animals. All kinds: zoo animals, pets and even rodents. Whatever is fluffy will be adored by me.
				</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2>Work 💪</h2>
				<p>
					Although I may have a childish passion for animals, I am also a hardworker. I love facing new challenges and delivering quality work!
